          { "question": "What exactly is included in the €400?", "answer": "EVERYTHING listed above: complete responsive website, logo creation (if needed), typography selection, complete local SEO optimization, Google Maps integration, Google Business Profile optimization, client review display, contact form, first year hosting, first year domain name, SSL certificate, and training. Authentication and booking systems are available as options with additional cost depending on complexity." },
          { "question": "How many pages are included for €400?", "answer": "The standard package includes 5 essential pages: Home, Services/Offerings, About, Contact, and FAQ. If you need additional pages, we can add them with a reasonable supplement (typically €50-80 per additional page)." },
          { "question": "I don't have a logo, is it really included?", "answer": "Yes! If you don't have a logo yet, I create a professional visual identity adapted to your industry. You'll receive 2-3 design proposals and we'll refine the one you prefer until you're completely satisfied." },
          { "question": "How does SEO optimization work?", "answer": "I do thorough keyword research for your sector and geographic area (city, region). I then optimize each page with these keywords: titles, descriptions, tags, structured content. I also add Schema.org markup for LocalBusiness, create an XML sitemap, and submit your site to Google Search Console. Result: you appear in relevant local searches." },
          { "question": "In which geographic area can I be visible?", "answer": "Your visibility depends on your service area. I can optimize for a specific city (e.g., 'plumber Paris 15'), multiple cities (e.g., 'restaurant Lyon Villeurbanne'), or an entire region (e.g., 'landscaper Île-de-France'). The more targeted your area, the better your positioning." },
          { "question": "How do you improve my Google Business Profile?", "answer": "I optimize your existing listing or create it if necessary: I choose the right categories (primary + secondary), write an SEO-optimized description with keywords, add all relevant attributes to your business, structure your services with prices if applicable, add quality photos, and link your website. All this improves your visibility on Google Maps and in the Knowledge Panel." },
          { "question": "Will my Google reviews really be displayed on my site?", "answer": "Yes, I integrate a widget that displays your Google reviews in real-time on your homepage. This immediately strengthens visitor trust and improves your conversion rate. It's like having your social proof directly on your site." },
          { "question": "What's the online booking system?", "answer": "If your activity requires appointments (restaurant, hair salon, doctor, coach, etc.), I can integrate an online booking calendar. Your clients choose their slot, receive automatic email confirmation, and you manage your availability from a simple interface. It's an additional option as it requires more development." },
          { "question": "What's the authentication system for?", "answer": "If you offer services requiring a private client area (training, subscriptions, private documents, personalized tracking), I can create a secure registration/login system. Your clients create an account, log in, and access their personalized content. It's also an option with additional cost." },
          { "question": "How long to receive my site?", "answer": "Allow 7 to 14 business days depending on complexity and availability of your content (texts, photos). If you provide everything quickly, I can deliver in 7 days. If we need to create a logo and optimize a lot of content, it may take 14 days." },
          { "question": "What do I need to provide to start?", "answer": "Very simple: basic information (name, address, phone, email, hours), description of your services/products, texts to present your company, quality photos if you have them (otherwise I can help you find or create visuals), and your logo if you have one. I guide you step by step with a detailed questionnaire." },
          { "question": "After delivery, do you abandon me?", "answer": "Never! You have 30 days of free support after delivery for any questions or small adjustments. After that, I remain available on WhatsApp for occasional changes (typically €30-50/hour for minor changes). You can also subscribe to a monthly maintenance plan (from €49/month) for regular updates." },
          { "question": "Do I really own my site 100%?", "answer": "Absolutely. You own your domain name, your hosting, and all your site files. I give you all access and you're free to go to another provider at any time. No tricks, no forced subscription. It's YOUR site." },
          { "question": "Why €400 when others offer cheaper?", "answer": "Because I include EVERYTHING: custom design (not generic template), logo if needed, real SEO optimization (not just installing a plugin), Google Business Profile integration and optimization, personalized training, and clean, fast code. Others offer cheaper but with basic templates, no real SEO, and no support. You pay for a result that generates clients, not just a pretty site." },
          { "question": "Can I see examples of sites you've created?", "answer": "Yes of course! Check out my portfolio on the homepage or contact me directly on WhatsApp to see projects similar to your business. I'll be happy to show you concrete achievements." },
          { "question": "What if I want additional features?", "answer": "No problem! The €400 package is a solid foundation. If you want to add features like booking system, authentication, an e-commerce store, or a blog with CMS, we can create a custom quote. I'm flexible and adapt to your needs and budget." },
          { "question": "How does payment work?", "answer": "Simple and secure: €200 deposit at project start to secure my availability and begin work, then €200 at final delivery once you're satisfied. Payment by bank transfer or PayPal according to your preference." },
          { "question": "I'm not in France, do you work internationally?", "answer": "Yes, I work with clients throughout the francophone world (France, Belgium, Switzerland, Canada, French-speaking Africa, etc.). Local SEO optimization adapts to your country and language. The principles are the same everywhere." }
